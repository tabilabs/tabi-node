# Tabi Node 
This repository releases the GUI installation package (Windows, Mac platform) and Linux cli program required for pre-mining.
## Getting Started
Dear Captain Node Owner, it's time to activate your Captain Node and start pre-mining on Tabi Testnet V2 Yoake. This will help you get familiar with the node usage process after the mainnet launches more quickly. We will also incentivize all captain node owners who participate in pre-mining on Tabi Testnet V2 Yoake.
### Windows
